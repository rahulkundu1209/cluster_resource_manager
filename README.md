# Project Name: Cluster Resource Manager
## Project Description:
A Cluster Resource Manager is responsible for monitoring, allocating, and managing computing resources (CPU, memory, I/O) across a cluster of servers or nodes. This project implements a simplified version of such a system using C++, focusing on:
Efficient load balancing
Task allocation
Node health monitoring
Failover and recovery strategies
It simulates a multi-node environment and manages job distribution, node status, and resource usage dynamically.
## Objectives
Resource Allocation: Distribute tasks based on CPU/memory availability across nodes.
Load Balancing: Ensure balanced workload across all nodes to prevent overload.
Health Monitoring:Periodically check node status (up/down, resource usage).
Failover Mechanism:Automatically reassign tasks if a node fails or becomes unresponsive.
Performance Logging:Record node performance statistics and task execution logs.
